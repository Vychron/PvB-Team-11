A town management game that teaches people how to program

In this game you control your town by ordering the people inside to expand the town and take care of themselves.
This game is inspired by The Sims and Settlers of Catan, as you both build your own place, and have the people take care of themselves,
and you will need to gather and trade your resources in order to do so.

Giving order to the villagers can be done in 2 ways:
- Using a blockly inspired system to build actions
- Writing the actions like you would write them as a line of code in a script

Most actions you can create will be assigned to a villager, and can not be performed when there aren't any villagers available.
To determine whether or not a villager is available is done fairly easily, as they will be wandering around.

In order to attract more people to your village, you will have to make sure that the village has a place for them to stay, and the village needs to be impressive enough.
If a village isn't impressive enough or there aren't any unoccupied houses, people won't be joining your village.

It is also important to keep your villagers happy.
How impressive your village is, depends on how satisfied your villagers are.
If villagers are unhappy, they won't enjoy living in your town, making the village less impressive.
If villagers are unhappy for too long, they will leave the village.
